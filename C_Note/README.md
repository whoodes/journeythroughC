# C Note

This is a mock-banking program utilizing a bootstrapped linked list composed of struct records.
The data held in the record can be viewed in the record.h file.  I learned a great deal about working
with memory management between the stack and heap.  I also learned to truly appreciate the function-debugging
methodology of memory tracing.
