# Heaps, and stacks, and pointers, oh my...

A repo to track my work throughout my program structure course.  The project for
the next couple of months will be building a mock banking database program.

I will commit each subsequent module of the bank program.  The initial stage is
building the basic menu system, to be completed by 9/22/2018, along with
skeleton definitions of the included functions.

#### Update: 
Initial banking program commit on 9/22/2018.  Initiate Phase II.

#### Update: 
Added IO functions and driver on 10/06/2018.  addRecord pesudocode
completed.  ~~deleteRecorded pseudocode coming soon...~~ (already added)

#### Update: 
On 10/24/2018, C_Note has had all data functions implemented.  Additionaly, a readfile function 
runs as the program starts up and writes the data from the linked list to the file
upon exit.  If the file exists, it is over-written.  Also, cleaned up debugger metadata
appearance.
