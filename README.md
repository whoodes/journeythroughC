# journeythroughC

A repo to track my work throughout my program structure course.  The project for
the next couple of months will be building a mock banking database program.

I will commit each subsequent module of the bank program.  The initial stage is
building the basic menu system, to be completed by 9/22/2018, along with
skeleton definitions of the included functions.

UPDATE: Initial banking program commit on 9/22/2018.  Initate Phase II.
