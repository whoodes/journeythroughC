# I came, I saw, I coded

This project consists of the work I have completed throughout my program structure course.
The outcome thus far has been a firm grasp on the language itself, as well as understanding complex pointer manipulation.
This being exemplified in the [C Note](https://whoodes.github.io/journeythroughC/C_Note/) 
mock banking program. This program was also re-created in [C++](https://github.com/whoodes/journeythroughC/tree/master/C_Note_plusplus).

A better understanding of the intricacies involved in a low-level langauge has strengthened my skills as a budding computer
scientist.  Refining my thought process in regards to debugging and problem solving has developed as a result.
Implementing a linked list abstract data type in C from scratch, using the dynamic set operations including insert(x),
delete(x), search(x), successor(x), and predecessor(x) was a very humbling and rewarding experience.
