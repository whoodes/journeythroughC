# I came, I saw, I coded

This project consists of the work I have completed throughout my program structure course.
All of the coding thus far (10/25/2018) has been writen in C.  The outcome thus far has
been a firm grasp on the language itself, as well as understanding complex pointer manipulation.
This being exemplified in the [C Note](https://whoodes.github.io/journeythroughC/C_Note/) 
mock banking program.  A better understanding of how programming works in a low-level langauge has
strengthened my skills as a programmer.  The refining of my thought process in regards to debugging 
and problem solving has developed as a result.  Implementing a linked list abstract data type in C, 
along with the dynamic set operations including insert(x), delete(x), search(x), successor(x), and 
predecessor(x) was a very humbling and rewarding experience.

## Not done yet

Now, comes bitwise operations and a brief introduction into c++.
